Data Modelling Case Study -1
--------------------------------

Requirement :
An Automation gaint had been using multiple DB's and multiple warehouses from long time which created repeated and outdaed ifnormation.
Issues mentioned :
-------------------
. Data must be integrated from different Applications in JSON format
. Different Data Modelling techniques used to store data in different DB's
. Storing redundant data results in improper utilization of resources
Additional info: 
------------------
.Personalized server must be created and deployed at minimal cost and in lesser period

Two DBA's propsed plan approaches via SQL DB and Non SQL DB 

Analysis/ Answer:
-------------------------------------------

DBA A Proposed Plan: DB Type - Oracle ; Employees Reqd: 20 ; Time needed - 14-15 months ; Resource Requirement - 3 instances ; Performance - 3 iteration performance enhancement
----------------------

--> Disadavantages :
	. As Application needs data in JSON format, retreving and data conversion will be more effort
	. Cost will be more as needed more employess and need more time to compelte the migration
	. Manitenance will be tough by choosing the Oracle DB

DBA B Propsed Solution: DB Type - NoSQL ; Employees Reqd: 3-4 ; Time needed - 4 months ; Resource Requirement - 1 instances ; Performance - official drivers can be implemented to integrate with Apps
-------------------------

--> Advantages :
	. Faster , Easy Maintenance and cost effective and satisfies all requirements given for project
	. Avoid of complex data modelling including primary kwy and foreign key concept
	
	Disadvantages :
	. More duplicate data might be inserted into documents
	
Conclusion : Considering above 2 options DBA B 's plan is good and selected to implemented
