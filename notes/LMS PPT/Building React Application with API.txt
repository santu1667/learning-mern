Building React Application with Native API:
    - Native Modules: A native module is a set of javascript functions that are implemented
        natively for each platform.
        - used where native capabilities are needed , when react native lacks a corresponding 
        module or where the performance needs to be better.
    
    ** Navigation Libraries : There are 2 majorly used libraries for navigaiton.
        - React Navigation : written in JS and doesnt directly use the native navigation API's
            on IOS and Android
            - recreates some subset of those API'set
            - it allows integration of 3r party JS plugins , max customization , easier debugging
        
        - React Native Navigation : This uses native navigation API's hence the look and feel is 
        more like native

    ** React Native and Redux: Requirements to perfomr the integration of React native and 
        redux are:
        - React : To build and manage UI and also hanlde async actions
        - Redux : To manage state
        - React native: To provide mobile application development platform.

        Redux Thunk : middleware that lets us call action creators that returns a function 
            instead of an action object.
            - This function receives store dispatch methodwhich is used to dispatch regular
            synchronous actions.
            - Most common use of Thunk is communicating asynchronously with API's to retreive 
            and save data.
            Syntax : npm install --save redux-thunk
            npm i react-redux, npm i expo-cli, npm i redux-thunk
