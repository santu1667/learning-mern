--> Software Testing: process to evaluate the functionality of a software application to 
        check if application met the specified requirements or not and to produce a bug
        free quality product.

    - Types of testing: 

        * Unit Testing: Test small pieces of independent code
            used to prevent frequent happening bugs, easy to pinpoint and fix the problem,
            - if taking more time to complete menas the code is written in too complex manner,
            - Jest is one fo the popular tool for unit testing.

        * Functional Testing: Tests which are made against combination of many units.
            - can use any number of external objects like DB's,UI,Security
            - takes longer time than unit test
            - Funcitonal tests represents major changes and unit tests are minor

        * Integration Testing: Ensures the entire system is working properly.
            - can be executed only in real environment.
            - slower than remaining tests and are complex to write.

    --> Testing of React Application :

        * Jest - fast testing framework and it acts as runner, assertion library and 
            mocking library
        * Enzyme - JS testing utility for react makes it to easier for assert, manipulate and 
            traverse react components output.
            - Provides additional methods for rendering component, finding elementd and interacting
            with elements.
            - create-react-app comes with Jest but enzyme needs to be installed seperately.

            Syntax : install Jest : npm install --save-dev jest babel-jest
                            Enzyme: npm install enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 enzyme-to-json
                            Update package.json with "jest":{
                                "snapshotSerailizers":["enzyme-to-json/serializer"]
                            }
        * Nginx: web server software by which we can make sure our page load times are reduced.
            - An open source software and provides HTTP server capabilities
            - mainly used for load balancing, reverse proxing and caching
            - Designed for maximum performance and stability.
            - uses non threaded and event driven architecture.

        * Docker : build, deploy and run the Applications anywhere by using containers.
            - Docker file : basic building block of docker containers.
            - file with set of instructions and forms the base for any docker image
            - Every time , base image is going to be based on another image. We need to build 
            or application on the base image.
