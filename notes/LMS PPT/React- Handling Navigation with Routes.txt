----> Routing :
        - Process of mapping from the URL to rendered content.
        - It helps user to move to different parts of Application when he enters URL or
           clicks an element with in the Application.
        - To define the route we need the exact URL and component to be rendered

        - react-route is the library used to integrate routes in react Application.
        - react-route split into react-router-dom (web Applications)and 
          react-router-native (Native Applications)

          Syntax to install - npm install react-router-dom

    ----> Features :
        - Navigating backward and forward in the Application restoring the state and maintain
          the history of Application
        - Rendering Appropriate components as per the URL.
        - Redirecting user from one route to another.
        - Rendering a 404 page when the URL doesnt had any proper route component to render

        React routers had number of routes and depending on requirements an dPlatform we cna use
        the corresponding
        Browser routes : by dynamic webnsites to route to different URL's
        Hash Route : used by static websites to resppond the requests of its files
        Memory Route : used to store the hostiry of URL, used by non browser applications like
                        react native applications.

        404 Not found : Switch statement used to display Not found incase if no routes found

        ---> Dynamic Routes : URL Params are the parameters which are used to set dynamically
                in page URL.
                Nested Routing concept of route under another route
              - Nav links are used to add style attributes 

        ----> API - Code that governs the access point of your application to communicate with 
                other applications in agreed way like request and response
                - Rest Api allows us to access and manipulate resources using HTTP protocols
                - REST API prefereed in most of Applications as this returns the JSON response
                  undersatnd by most of Applications

                - To create a rest PI temporarily we can use json-server. We need to install
                  json server 
                  npm install -g json-server
                  create a file with mock response data
                  start json server using json-server --watch <jsonfileName> --port <portNumber>

                - How to consume API created in React Application:
                ** Promises used to handle asynchronous operations in java script and provides better
                   error handling than callback and event functions

                   Promise functions takes only one call back function.
                   var promise = new Promise(function(resolve,reject))

                   fetch method used to call API , wher we resolve promise to get data and use it to 
                   render on UI.
