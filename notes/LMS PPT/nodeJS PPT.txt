---> Client Server Architecture:
                                                    Request
        Users ()    --------->      Application    -------->      Server          <------->          Data base 
                    interacts                       <--------
                                                    Response

                    Frontend                                                Backend

    1. Front end development :

        Html - Content of web pages
        CSS -  Style , layout of the web pages
        JS -   To program behavior of the web pages
    
    2. Backend development:

        Server side Application which handles business login , Security inorder to ensure application is operational.
        (Server side technologies - Ruby, Node JS, PHP, Python)

        Why Node jS : same JS language in frontend and backend which makes seamless client-server communication.It is fast, scalable and 
                      has large ecosystem of open source library which makes it ideal for real time applications.

        Case Study - Paypal moved from Java to node JS and had below advantages :
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------
        1. Can be built 2 times faster with less number of resources 
        2. Lesser code and files compared to Java Application
        3. No need to wait for server side modifications for a particular server side developer
        4. Average response time improves a lot.

        Node JS :

        i.  Javascript runtime built on chrome's v8 Javascript engine , uses event driven , non blocking I/o model makes it lightweight 
            and more efficient.
        ii. single threaded , non- blocking and Asynchronous manner.

        Installation of Node JS and VS Code 
        -------------------------------------------------------------------

        Module --> Functionlaity which is organised in sinlge or multiple JS file and can be used throughout the node JS Application
            Syntax:  import {module} from 'module_name'  or var module= require('module_name')
            Types of Modules :
            ----------------
            . Core Modules : These are inbuilt modules and will come by default and no need to install them seperately
                1. fs - Handles the file systmes
                        const fs = require('fs');
                        fs.writeFileInSync('app.txt', 'This is a test file')
                2. path - Handles paths and directories
                        var path= require('path');
                        var p= 'C:\Learning\MERN\learning-mern\LMS\CRUD\Case Study I\users-case study.txt';
                        console.log(path.dirname(p) +'   ' +path.basenme('p')+ '   '+ path.extname('p')+ '   '+path.isAbsoulte('p'))
                        o/p: C:\Learning\MERN\learning-mern\LMS\CRUD\Case Study I   users-case study.txt     txt   true
                3. buffer - Handles binary Data
                        var buffer1 = Buffer.from('123456789');
                        var buffer2 = Buffer.from('HELLO');
                        buffer2.copy(buffer1,2);
                        console.log(buffer1.toString()); - 12HELLO89
                        console.log(Buffer.concat([buffer1,buffer2]).toString()); - 12HELLO89HELLO
                        console.log(buffer1.equals(buffer2)); - false
                        console.log(Buffer.compare(buffer1,buffer2)); : -1
                4.http - This makes Node JS acts like http server
                        var http = require('http');
                        http.createServer(function(req,res);
                        {
                            res.writeHead(200, {Content-Type:'text/plain'});
                            res.write('Hello World');
                            res.end();
                        }).listen(8080);
                5. url - parses url Strings
                        var url = require('url')
                        var adr= 'http://localhost:8080/default.htm?year=2022&month=June';
                        var q=url.parse(adr,true);
                        console.log(q.host); - localhost:8080
                        console.log(q.pathname); /default.htm
                        console.log(q.search)  ?year=2022&month=June
                6. util - used to access the Utility functions
                        var util = require('util')
                        var txt= 'Congratulations %s on his %dth birthday! ';
                        var result= util.format(txt, 'Santosh', 34) - COngratulate Santosh on his 34th birthday
                7. os - Helps getting information about operating sysytem
                        var os=require('os');
                        console.log('Platform' : os.platform()); - Win11
                        console.log('Architecture' : os.arch()); - X64
            . Node Package Manager : These include a group of Modules or packages, developed by other developers which can be used by
                                    installing them
                        npm init - this command will create a file named package.json, file contains metadata(identifying metadata, functional
                                metadata)
                        npm install <packagename> - npm install chalk@2.42 - install chalk package version 2.4.2
                            When we run npm install , Package manager uses package.json file as reference and installs all the listed 
                            modules from npm server.

                            npm_modules folder in your application would contain all the codes for dependencies which we installed

                            package-lock.json contian extra information version of depedency and where it is fetched format

                            To install locally, use require('packagename') to load dependencies from node module

                            chalk = require('chalk');
                            console.log(chalk.green('This is Santosh')+
                                    chalk.blue.underline.bold(' trying the npm module ')+ 'with chalk module')
                        
                        npm Local Packages vs Global Packages - 
                        Installed in directory where u run npm install  vs Placed in single folder of system
                        (npm install <packagename>   vs npm install -g <packagename>)

                        can have different versions in different applicaitons vs can have single version of same package

                        easy to handle when there is upgrade of package        vs        Difficult to handle

                        Occupied more memory     VS        Less memory

                        use it to execute any commands     VS only shell commands

                        Global Package - nodemon - restarts node application Automatically after detecting changes


            . User Defined Modules: These are created by individuals.
                   create date.js which gives sysytem dat whenever called
                            Console.log('Entering into User Defined Module');
                            var currentDateTime = function(){
                                return Date
                            }
                            module.exports = currentDateTime;
                    How to use this in other files
                            var date = require('./date.js');
                            Console.log("Current Date and Time: "+ date);


        ----> Git Hub : version control system that documents the changes to a file or set of files. Allows multiple users 
                to manage multiple revisions of same information.
