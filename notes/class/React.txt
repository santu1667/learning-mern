---> State of Component:
        Each component is react had its own state and is responsible to manage its state
        For this react had inbuilt lib 'useState' basically called as "hook"
        
        import React.{useState} from 'react';
        callign useState gives a new state variable and a function that can call to alter its value 

        Hook: functions which are linked to state and life cycle of components
        useState - hook to manage state
        useEffect - hook to access components life cycle - will be passed as a funciton when we use this hook. The fucntion
                will be run by react when the component first rendered and also runs on every subsequent re-render/update

        Props : Intial values passed on to a function
